WM data is at FE8U:03005280 and is layed out as follows:
    +00 | byte  | flags 
    +01 | byte  | "display cursor"?
    +02 | short | camera x (in what units?)
    +04 | short | camera y (in what units?)
    +08 | word  | cursor x (pixels, increments by 0x10)
    +0C | word  | cursor y (pixels, increments by 0x10)
    +10 | units[7], struct:
        +00 | byte  | flags (&1 = enabled?, &2 = use class instead of char)
        +01 | byte  | location id
        +02 | short | character/class id
    +30 | nodes[0x1C], struct:
        +00 | word  | flags (&1 = enabled, &2 = is next story location)
    +A4 | byte[0x20] | enabled paths
    +C4 | word | path count
    +C8 | byte | entry node id?
    +C9 | byte[3] | List of active world map skirmishes
    +CC | byte | used to determine which skirmish enemy block to load
    +CD | byte | used for shops on the world map

Flags at byte 00:
    &01h = set if currently on world map (used with shop screens and item management screens to determine where to kick the player back to when backing out)
    &02h = enable player control (unset when moving to the next story location and the cutscene plays)
    &04h = minimap enabled (press Select to toggle)
    &08h = hide map sprites
    &10h = when set, moves the minimap to right of screen instead of left (used so that the minimap doesn't overlap the cursor, automatically set by the MoveCursor functions)
    &20h = unknown
    &40h = set by EventC1_SkipWM, probably skips drawing world map
    &80h = unknown, set by EventC2_

Nodes are saved as words, but only 2 bits are ever used. You could restructure these to be saved as shorts or even bytes with no ill effects, simply by changing the arguments of a few `lsl` and `add` opcodes.

referencing FE8U:080A70B0 ("SaveWMStuff"), load func is FE8U:080A7138 ("LoadWMStuff")

saves 0x24 bytes (writes to sp before calling the save writing function)

bytes 0x00 to 0x07 are location/node data:
    080A6DA0 saves for each location/node two bits of info, packed
    Since there's room for 0x1C nodes, this means 0x38 bits = 7 bytes are used (one unused?)
    
    load func is 080A6E24

bytes 0x08 to 0x0B are route/path data:
    080A6EB0 saves a bitmap. Each bit represents a route id.
    for ex: if route 2 and 3 are active, it will save (binary) 0...0110
    there's 4 bytes, so max route id is 32
    
    load func is 080A6F0C

bytes 0x0C to 0x19 are actor/unit data: (this is what's at 03005280+$10)
    080A6F50 saves for each actor/unit a short (2 bytes), packed as follows:
        +00bit | 1bit | flag 0 at actor+00 (enabled?)
        +01bit | 6bit | location/node (actor+01)
        +07bit | 1bit | flag 1 at actor+00 (use class instead of char)
        +08bit | 8bit | character or class id (actor+02)
    there's 14 bytes for 7 actors/units
    
    load func is 080A6FBC

bytes 0x1A and 0x1B are saved cursor x and y, respectively

byte 0x1C is as follows:
    +00bit | 1bit | flag 1 (&2) of data+00
    +01bit | 1bit | flag 2 (&4) of data+00
    +02bit | 2bit | flags 4&5 (&0x30) of data+00
    
    I think, math is hard (I'm referencing 080A70F0~080A7124 if u don't trust me (you shouldn't))

bytes 0x1D to 0x1F is the skirmish array at data+C9, copied verbatim (func 080A7034 saves, 080A7054 loads)

byte 0x20 is skirmish state byte at data+CC copied verbatim

the last 3 bytes seem unused (padding?)
